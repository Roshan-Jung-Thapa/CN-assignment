What is OSI model and TCI/IP model?
-> The Open System Interconnect (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that describes
Networking or telecommunications system as seven layers. TCP/Ip stands for Transmission
Control Protocol and is a suit of communication protocols used to interconnect network
devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communication protocol in a private
computer network --an intranet or extranet.

The layers in OSI model and TCP ip models are :-

What are Seven layers of OSI model and write functions of each layers?
-> Physical Layer: Handles the physical connection between devices and the transmission of raw binary data over a medium. Involves cables, switches, and physical standards.
   Datalink Layer: Packages raw bits into frames for error detection/correction and controls access to the physical medium. Includes Ethernet and switches.
   Network Layer : Determines the best path for data to travel and handles logical addressing (IP addresses). Manages packet forwarding and routing.
   Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer between end systems, handles segmentation, reassembly, and flow control. Examples are TCP and UDP.
   Session Layer : Manages sessions between applications, including establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections. Controls dialog and synchronization.
   Presentation Layer: Translates data between the network and application formats, handles data encryption/decryption and compression. Ensures data is readable.
   Application Layer: Provides network services to end-users and applications, including protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. Supports resource sharing and user interfaces.

What are the principles behind the OSI model?
Layered Archietecture: Divides network functions into seven distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities. This modular approach simplifies network design and troubleshooting.
Layer Independence : Each layer operates independently, performing its designated function. Changes in one layer do not affect other layers, promoting flexibility and ease of updates.
Encapsulation : Data is encapsulated with protocol-specific headers as it moves down the layers, and headers are removed as it moves up the layers. This process ensures proper data handling and integrity.
standardization: Provides a universal set of protocols and standards that ensure different systems and technologies can communicate and interoperate effectively.
Modularity: Allows for modular network design, where individual layers can be updated or replaced without affecting the overall system. This supports technological advancements and system scalability.
Interoperability: Ensures that various hardware and software from different vendors can work together within a network, promoting compatibility and reducing vendor lock-in.
Transparency : Provides network transparency to the end user, masking the complexity of underlying network operations and protocols. Users can access and use network services without needing to understand the underlying details.
Error Handling and Recovery: Includes mechanisms for detecting and correcting errors that occur during data transmission, ensuring reliable communication.
Flow Control and Congestion Management: Implements flow control to manage the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver, and congestion management to prevent network overloads.
